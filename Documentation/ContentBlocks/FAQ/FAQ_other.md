# Additional FAQ to Content Block

## How can I switch from one CType to another without having to re-enter the content? 

This is not possible with different prefixes per CType. Perhaps a manual prefix could be defined so that, 
for example, an agency can define all its own content blocks on its own responsibility.

For now switching the CType without data loss won't be enabled. However, if the survey for editors proves that it is necessary, 
a strategy for this will be needed first.

## How will content blocks become compatible to extensions like indexed_search, ke_search, solr?

Introducing the content blocks package approach will be a breaking change. We offer working together with the extension authors.

## How can the content elements be imported and exported for localization? (Meaning content - not labels)

The default for a field will be localize-able, making this property only necessary if special localization method is required.
